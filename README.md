A Python Introduction to Earth Science!

This course uses Python programming and Jupyter Notebooks along with real-world observations to introduce students to Earth phenomena and their underlying physics. Students will learn how to access and visualize the data, extract signals, and make probability forecasts. The final module is a research project, of the students’ own design, that synthesizes the course material.
