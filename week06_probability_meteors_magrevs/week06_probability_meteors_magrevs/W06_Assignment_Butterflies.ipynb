    "In this notebook we will analyse butterfly egg populations to try to understand population dynamics and butterfly reproductive behaviour. The butterfly *Euphydryas gillettii* was introduced to Gunnison\n",
    "County, Colorado, USA. This population, located in the southern Rocky Mountains, is south of the butterfly’s natural range, which extends from southern Alberta to northern Wyoming. This butterfly lays it eggs on leaves of *Lonicera involucrata* in clusters (see picture). Multiple egg clusters may be found on each leaf. We will use field data collected from Colorado over 29 years, provided to me by Prof. Carol Boggs of the SEOE.\n",

    "We want to understand butterfly population dynamics. Imagine being in the field and finding a single leaf with 7 egg clusters on it! You might ask yourself, is this a particularly special leaf that the butterflies would favour depositing their eggs on? Maybe the female butterflies know which leaves increase the chance of their caterpillars surviving and so seek it out, or maybe it's just random chance that they all chose this leaf. We're going to test the hypothesis that this is just random chance and not motivated by butterfly behaviour.\n",
